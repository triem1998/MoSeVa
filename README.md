# MoSeVa: model selection with spectral variability based on manifold learning.

This is the repo for MoSeVa: an automatic identification and quantification algorithm which considers spectral variability for gamma-ray spectrometry.

The code is organized as follows:
-  The Code folder contains the source code for the IAE and the MoSeVa,P-OMP algorithm
-  The Data folder contains the dataset of 96 spectral signatures of 12 radionuclides as a function of steel thickness.
-  The Notebooks folder contains two jupyter notebook files for training an IAE model and using MoSeVa to identify and quantify the radionuclides
      - The Models folder contains the pre-trained IAE model.
